# NOTE: This is a very ugly solution. Ideally the wire_system would be built into an object library and then both the
#       consuming QSchematic library as well as this test suite would consume the object library. However this becomes
#       a pain to manage when installing QSchematic as static library.
#       Maybe we'll find a better way to handle this in the future.
